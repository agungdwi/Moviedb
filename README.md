## Introduction

This project is made to fulfill a Submission in Dicoding course and the last course in Android Learning path.

In this project, I learned many things, such as Clean architecture, Design Pattern, Networking with Retrofit, Reactive Programming with Coroutines Flow, Dependency Injection with Koin, Local Database with Room Persistence, Modularization, Dynamic Feature, Security, Useful Library, Continuous Integration, Performance, and many things.

i used the MVVM Architecture Pattern, Dependency Injection (DI) with Koin, and so many things that you can see at [here](#tech-stack).

I Use the [TheMovieDatabase](https://www.themoviedb.org/) for the data source. first thing first, you have to get the API Key from [TheMovieDatabase](https://www.themoviedb.org/).

I Hope this Project will help someone, if you feel helped with this project, you can give stars to support me, thank you very much :)
